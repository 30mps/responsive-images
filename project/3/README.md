# Responsive Images: 3 #

This is identical to the previous version, but the images have been optimized with ImageOptim.

Images have been put in figure elements and captions added with figcaption.

## To do ##
* Running ImageOptim didn't reduce total page weight very much: only around 4% per image on average. Try different settings and tools to see if you can reduce image sizes even further, while maintaining acceptable quality.
* For this and the previous example, you probably resized the images one by one and optimized them manually. That's not going to scale for a site with lots of content, multiple contributors and frequent changes. Using the tools and techniques described in the course, create a build process that automates image resizing and optimization.
* The figure element adds margins, but do you want these? What about the style of the captions? Try styling the figure and figcaption elements.
* Add a logo and social sharing icon links, using the techniques described in the course. (Hint: think SVG!)
