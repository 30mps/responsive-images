# Responsive Images: 1 #

With one simple change, layout now responds to viewport size: `img: max-width: 100%` FTW! Check with the Dev Tools: the page looks pretty good on small and large viewports.

To reiterate, `img: max-width: 100%` means 'expand the image display size to fit the container, but no larger than the natural width of the image'.

## Problems ##

* Page weight is no better.
* Layout still needs to be improved.
