# Responsive Images: 3 #

This version has a header element with a logo, a footer with sharing links – and the figure and figcaption elements have been styled.

## To do ##
* What about a responsive logo? Take a look at [this page](http://www.responsivelogos.co.uk/) for inspiration.
* The links are unstyled – what could you do to make them look better?
* What about Web Fonts? Try some different fonts and styles for body text, headings and captions. What might be problematic about using Web Fonts when connectivity is poor? What about mobile devices? Howe good are the fallbacks: how do browsers respond when Web Fonts aren't available?
